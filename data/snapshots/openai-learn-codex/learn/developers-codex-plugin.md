# OpenAI Developers plugin

The OpenAI Developers plugin helps you build AI applications and agents in
ChatGPT and Codex with OpenAI Platform access and OpenAI API setup guidance.
ChatGPT and Codex share its listing in the universal plugin directory.
Adaptations for Claude Code and Cursor bundle the portable developer skills and
public OpenAI Docs MCP server without the Codex-specific Platform connector. In
Codex, the plugin works with the OpenAI Docs skill bundled with your install.

It includes:

- **OpenAI API Platform:** connect ChatGPT or Codex to the
  [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
- **OpenAI Docs MCP:** use current OpenAI documentation from Claude Code or
  Cursor.
- **API key setup:** create, save, and connect a project API key from Codex, or
  get guided local `OPENAI_API_KEY` setup in Claude Code and Cursor.
- **Agents SDK:** build and deploy OpenAI Agents SDK apps from an idea, a repo,
  or a prior Codex task.
- **Troubleshooting:** identify common OpenAI API failures and route
  you to the right next step.

## Get started with Codex

If you are new to Codex, start here before installing the plugin:

1. [Download the ChatGPT desktop app](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app#getting-started) for macOS or Windows.
2. Follow the [Codex quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart) to sign in, choose a
   project, and send your first message.

       Enter `https://github.com/openai/openai-developers-for-claude` and select
       **Sync**. Do not append a `.git` suffix.

## Use the plugin

After installation, start building with your agent. ChatGPT or Codex can use
the plugin automatically when the task calls for OpenAI Platform interactions,
such as creating API keys or troubleshooting API issues. Claude Code and Cursor
can use the plugin's skills and bundled Docs MCP server for OpenAI API, model,
Agents SDK, and plugin guidance.

The plugin is useful when you want your coding agent to:

- build an app or agent that uses the OpenAI API
- set up OpenAI API access for the app you are building
- diagnose common OpenAI API errors and explain the next step.
